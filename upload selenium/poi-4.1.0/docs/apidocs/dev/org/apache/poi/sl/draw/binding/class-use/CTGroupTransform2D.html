00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:10,100
Hello and welcome with the API gateway scenario based practice questions that get to the first one.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,790
So the first question reads What are three types of back and endpoint axes that the Gateway facilitates.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,600
Remember that the API Gateway does what it gives you a front door.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,330
To your applications right.

5
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:33,640
So that of course will be coming from here and then it will go to one of potentially multiple destinations

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:43,010
one of them is Lamda an application or a custom code on easy to instances could be going into an API

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,170
supported Web site on easy to or else.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,180
And it could be headed to other services as well.

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,620
So if you go through with them the access to the back end is the two instances we are not using API

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,020
gateway to do SS etching in two easy to instances be invoking E.W. lambda functions.

11
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,090
This is correct.

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,670
See calling other of your services.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,110
Yes if they support API calls and they do support it because as we know so this is correct.

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:24,640
DB accessing and DTP Web site or web page API get we can be used for internet access from private subnets

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,560
and this is more of that gateway.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,460
So this is wrong.

17
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,250
And this one is correct.

18
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,660
So b c d r r correct answers and the rest.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,010
And we are wrong.

20
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,090
We can share for this question scope with Amazon API Gateway you can provide your clients with a consistent

21
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,050
and scalable programming interface to access three types of endpoint in the backend.

22
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:52,510
And these are the three types you can invoke lambda functions you can call other E.W. services easy

23
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:01,020
to included and you can access in private or public actually to be web site or web page at the backend.

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:06,750
Our second question reads your client is intending to use API gateway to access and run back in the

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,620
application code on Nunda in an effort to shift to us for this application.

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,740
So the use of API gateway here will be to invoke Alamdar function that will run code on lambda.

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,140
The client is anticipating growth in the number of requests or the number of requests coming to the

28
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,620
API gateway intended to the back end to run the lambda code or the lambda functions is anticipated to

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,610
be on the rise the number of requests per second to AB I get.

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,400
What other services are needed to ensure that the API that we can kill to these request growth.

31
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,550
What do you need to do as an architect.

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,560
To ensure that the API I get we can cater for the request increase that will be received by the AP I

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
get with it.

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,240
You need to configure E-L be an auto scaling to launch more easy to instances and manage that scaley

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,970
be stored that requests in it is done with the table.

36
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,220
So get the requests into a dynamic DV table and have a secure handle them to have you ask you to handle

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,620
the request to read the request and process them through an application.

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:21,740
You two instances so you need to build a code on an easy to instance that will be reading from the Escott.

39
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:29,010
Q Eskew the requests that are stored in Dunwoodie see use extra large computer optimized to instances

40
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,420
to cater for the increasing requests trate and the do nothing if I get it is money is a managed service

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,410
that can scale as needed.

42
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,380
So lets look at the choices a you need to configure.

43
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,190
Ill be an auto scaling to launch.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,140
You two instances and manage that scaling.

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,220
Of course this is wrong.

46
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,610
Why.

47
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,300
Because API Gateway is a fully managed service from each of us and it is this killing is included in

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,050
the fully managed service services we don't need to configure you'll be able to Schelling be Stalder

49
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,890
request in India as Dunwoodie be and have the schools handle them through.

50
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,690
As we mentioned earlier this is very complicated and you don't actually need to do much for that.

51
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,270
I get we just get it is designed as a killable service that can go to tens tens of thousands of requests

52
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,280
per second.

53
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,730
C use extra large of demises two instances along the same line.

54
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,580
The to do nothing.

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,530
If it was a managed service that can scale as needed and this is your correct answer.

56
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,010
So is the correct answer.

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,470
Fisher I wasn't able to get to it is a fully managed service fully managed means that it is providing

58
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,990
you the service and is responsible for its patching Management Administration scaling and all that.

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,350
That makes it easy for developers to publish Manstein monitor and secure IP eyes at any skill.

60
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,720
And the second point I wasn't able to get were handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:03,400
up to hundreds of thousands of concurrently API calls including traffic management authorization access

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,430
control monitoring and API version management.

63
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,460
So it is responsible for the whole thing.

64
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,540
You don't need to worry about anything when you think about getting.

65
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,460
Third question what are the benefits of using.

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,030
If I get to choose 4 usually in the exam you get between 1 and three choices.
