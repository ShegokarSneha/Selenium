1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,930
Want to come back with more it's curious and best practice questions.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,660
And here is another one.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,480
A junior architect in your team is facing a client issue and is unsure how to fix the client has a two

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,010
tier web application.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,310
It is not just that the web player is not performing correctly so there is a problem with the web app

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,350
and upon troubleshooting it was found that a lot of fights were dropped as the database layer is not

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,300
able to keep up with the right traffic load.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:42,000
So you have web app applications so this is a two tier web app and this is your database.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,850
There is transactions happening or communication happening between the app and the database for writes

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,490
and reads.

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,600
That's what the appendectomies are for but it is not just that the application layer is not working

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,010
fine and when they troubleshoot they found a lot of dropped rights between the app and database.

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,930
So there's a lot of the ADD would send to write the data.

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,370
Waiting for an acknowledgment.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,120
Probably that an agent is not coming back.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,990
Or it never comes back or takes time to come back.

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,810
So the application now is not performing well.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:23,300
The junior architect is asking how can she offload the database right.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,980
Is there a way to overload the database rights such that the application layer can function normally

20
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:36,370
without having to wait for the data with little acknowledgement for the right sent and keeping cost

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:41,040
effectiveness in mind so the client want to fix the problem cost effectively.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,270
And what she is asking what the architect is asking is can I write somehow to another place not the

23
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,530
database directly and keep the application.

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,170
So the opposition will write and then we'll keep going with process more requests and will keep writing

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,720
to that third party or third place or location without depending on writing to the database and waiting

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,910
for the database to respond.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,780
Is there a way to do that.

28
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,220
That's the question you have from the junior architect in your team with cost effectiveness in mind.

29
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:25,160
A migrate the current database layer to Dynamo DBI which will be able to cater for the right load be

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,940
decoupled the two layers by changing the web app layer to write to an Eskew.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:39,410
So instead of writing to the database why don't you write to an obscure Q then launch a new app component

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,250
that will write to read it later.

33
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:48,870
So here write to the queue then have a new component on an elastic easy to group for instance.

34
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,800
All what it will do is go find out if there is any data to be read into the database and then write

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,740
it to the database.

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:04,510
And here now the database and the application it's up to them to work at whatever speed or rate in order

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:12,370
for that is to be able to not to miss any rights and to achieve the goal which is have the application

38
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:20,580
being independent from the database performance see modified the application to write two and three

39
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,960
bucket then have him or move the data to the database.

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:32,610
So save all the data into an S3 bucket and then have him are launching in March last year basically

41
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,660
that will read the data and transfer it to your database.

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,980
The spent fuel replicas of the Digby's layer and direct read operations to that he jumped.

43
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,390
All right so let's go through the and it's a good day.

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,310
It really is a dynamo D-B which will be able to get the food right.

45
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:57,510
That's excellent and dining with the we can scale and it is a web too as they call a database non-sequel

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,200
So it's very fast.

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,540
However this is a major migration and you're talking about dynamically be changing the database and

48
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,030
whatever data is they had.

49
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,120
They had skills to run that database but now are asking for more new skills as well for the operations

50
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,500
they are complicating the migration and you're completely complicating the ongoing administration.

51
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,840
So you did not actually keep cost effective in mind.

52
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,450
You did not keep cost effectiveness in mind that's why it is wrong.

53
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,740
The decouple the two leaders by changing the airplane to right to an excuse.

54
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,500
Q then launch a new app component that will rise to the data base layer it will work but depending on

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,130
the cost of the new app component that you will do see where if the application right on S-3 back and

56
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,220
then have EMR move the data to the database.

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,450
Now we are getting 3 into play storage costs and in my cost or cost as well.

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,370
So despite it will work I believe this might end up being more expensive these 10 Furio replicas of

59
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,110
the distributor layer and that really operations to the reader because so here its indirectly trying

60
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,280
to fix the problem by database had writes and reads.

61
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,090
So here what Im saying is why dont you spin a few Republicans have their IT operations be served from

62
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,860
the Republicans and that it will be on the rights.

63
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,830
Well that that could work but we dont know how much that will offload.

64
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:42,740
I mean is that a mini Debbies intensive right operations here or ther
